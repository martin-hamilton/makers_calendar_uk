Alpaca Festival Sheffield, 2025-09-12, 10:00, 2025-09-14, 23:00:00, "The festival of Algorithmic Patterns in the Creative Arts. If you are curious about strange patterns in different forms then this one is for you! There'll be a top notch algorave with people writing code to make electronic dance music, also a concert with pattern-based instrumental music and closing party that'll be a blend of the two. There will also be loads of talks about different kinds of strange patterns. We'll announce the hands-on workshops soon too - ~10 different workshops to choose from around patterns in juggling, textiles, music etc. A mix of heritage/craft workshops and more tech-infused ones. It'll be a bit unfashionable in having little or no AI stuff. Any algorithms involved will be wholesomely handmade by humans, whether ancient procedures from craft/music practice or live coding/algorave. There'll also be an online conference running through the event and into the following weekend, with watch parties in Berlin and Sheffield.", https://2025.algorithmicpattern.org/sheffield/, 53.3708757, -1.4768827

There will be a morning (09:30-12:00) and an afternoon session (14:00-16:30), with interactive workshops and hands-on activities for those with younger children, and tours and talks for older groups. All sessions will start with a short introduction to the lab. Please only book on the morning or afternoon session. After selecting your tickets, you'll be able to choose which tour, or interactive workshop, you'd like to attend - although please do note that as a working lab we do occasionally have to change our schedules at the last minute.  We're really looking forward to welcoming you to the lab! If you can't make it in person, please do join us online, where we'll be streaming our talks (and live links to CERN, home to the largest experiment in the world!) live.", https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/rutherford-appleton-laboratory-public-access-day-tickets-1409230258639, 51.5745237, -1.3173182
